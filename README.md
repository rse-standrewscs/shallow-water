Fortran 3D shallow water code by David Dritschel

## Installation

Requires the latest stable Rust compiler (Minimum Supported Rust Version still to be specified), which can be installed with [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

In the root directory of the project:

```
cargo install --path .
```

This will build and place a `shallow-water` binary in `~/.cargo/bin/` (which is added to `PATH` by default in the `rustup` installer).

### Usage

```
$ shallow-water --help
shallow_water 0.1.0

USAGE:
    shallow-water --parameters <PARAMETERS> [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -p, --parameters <PARAMETERS>    Path to file containing simulation parameters.

SUBCOMMANDS:
    balinit    Re-initialises a flow with balanced fields obtained from the conditions delta_t=gamma_t=0 using data
               previously set up with a data generation routine.
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    nhswps     The Horizontally Doubly-Periodic Three-Dimensional Non-Hydrostatic Shallow-Water Pseudo-Spectral
               Method
    swto3d     Converts 2D shallow-water fields to 3D fields needed by nhswps.
    vstrip     Initialises a PV strip with zero fields of divergence and acceleration divergence.
```

`cargo run` can be used to run from the source directory without installation.

For example:

```
cargo run --release -- -p parameters.yaml vstrip
cargo run --release -- -p parameters.yaml balinit
cargo run --release -- -p parameters.yaml swto3d
cargo run --release -- -p parameters.yaml nhswps
```

### Testing

To run the inexpensive tests:

```
cargo test --release
```

To run the expensive (and therefore ignored by default) tests:

```
cargo test --release -- --ignored
```

If the `--release` flag is not set the tests may be slow and the expensive tests may take a _very_ long time to complete.

### Benchmarking

[Criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) is the benchmarking framework used for this project. To run all benchmarks use:

```
cargo bench
```
